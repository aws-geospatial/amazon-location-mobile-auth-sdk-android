# Amazon Location Service Mobile Authentication SDK for Android

These utilities help you authenticate when making [Amazon Location Service](https://aws.amazon.com/location/) API calls from your Android applications. This specifically helps when using [Amazon Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/authenticating-using-cognito.html) or [API keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/using-apikeys.html) as the authentication method.

## Usage

Import the library and call the utility functions in the top-level namespace as needed. You can find more details about these functions in the [Documentation](#documentation) section.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available on the Amazon Location Service documentation website: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/using-amazon-location.html
